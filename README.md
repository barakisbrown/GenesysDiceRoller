**GenesysDiceRoller -- Genesys Diceroller written in Python**

Requirements:
* Python 3.5+
* Genesys RPG

This simple app will allow anyone that has access to python that also plays the Genesys RPG
to have a dice roller for it. The official mobile app by Fantasy Flight for the game is 
awesome but I built this for my love of the game plus to learn how to use python. I do hope
you enjoy it.
